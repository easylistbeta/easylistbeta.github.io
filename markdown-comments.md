# Comments in GitHub flavour of Markdown

As answers to [this Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4823468/store-comments-in-markdown-syntax) 
reveal, using `<!---` and `--->` works (view source by clicking "Raw"):

<!---
All this should be 
commented out
-->

## Inline comments

But the above doesn't work for inline comments. :-(

How about commenting out <!--- just ---> a part of one line?

If you know of a way, please show me how by cloning this Gist, or commenting below!
